# Process Optimization

WORK IN PROGRESS
Process optimization library.

## Features

---

Algorithms (TODO):

* Schrage
* Carlier
* Simulated Annealing


## Development and branching strategy

---

Specfic branch names:

* Main: "`main`"
* Develop: "`branch_develop`"
* Feature: "`ISSUENUMBER-short-lowercase-description`" e.g. "`6-make-better-readme`"

Branching strategy:

## Useful tips

* For running test in a more visually appealing way use the
  `cargo-nextest` crate.
* For drawing the module tree of your crate use `cargo-modules` crate
* For manipulating the Cargo.toml in cmd use `cargo-edit` crate
* For cheking if your deps have security vulnerabilities use `cargo-audit` crate
* Tox like task definition using `cargo-make`
* For smootinh the release process use `cargo-release`
